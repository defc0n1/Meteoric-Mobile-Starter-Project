# Meteoric-Mobile-Starter-Project
A full-featured starter project for a tabbed mobile app with a list (the "star" section), using [Meteor](www.meteor.com) &amp; [Meteoric (Meteor-Ionic)](https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic).  I've used the [Meteor Device Detection package](https://github.com/mystor/meteor-device-detection) and extensive dynamic templating to create alternate views for non-mobile screens, which sometimes require separate logic.

Check out the demo here: http://meteoric-starter.meteor.com/

Be sure to check out the mobile (Meteoric) views by clicking the device mode toggle in your browser's dev tools, or clone the repo and [test on your real device](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Cordova-Phonegap-integration).
